# viz-wiz-answerable-classifier

## Background

INF385T Spring 2018 Lab Assignment 4 at UT Austin consisted of a challenge to predict whether a visual question is answerable. This task required creating a multi-modal (computer vision + natural language processing) classification system. The dataset for this challenge was the VizWiz dataset with its pre defined train/validation/test split (dataset: http://vizwiz.org/data/, paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08218).
